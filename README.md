# Philio PAN06 SmartThings

Hello all,

This is my second published device handler, so I welcome any advice or suggestions.
This is based on other handlers with modifications to make it work for this device. I have removed loads of seemingly unnecessary code although there are a couple of sections which may still be unnecessary.
I have had it running for a while and it seems to all work...

...but I have no real experience of Groovy or SmartThings, so if there are better ways of doing things please let me know?

These devices have two channels for two switches, the challenge was being able to read and set the status of each switch separately.  But this handler now does this.
